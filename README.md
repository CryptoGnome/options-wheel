# WheelForge - Professional Options Wheel Strategy Platform

An enterprise-grade automated trading system implementing the options wheel strategy with advanced position management, automatic rolling, and intelligent risk controls.

## 🎯 What is WheelForge?

WheelForge is a production-ready automated trading platform that executes the options wheel strategy using the Alpaca Trading API. Built with reliability and profitability in mind, it features enterprise-grade error handling, intelligent position management, and sophisticated risk controls that go beyond basic wheel implementations.

### The Wheel Strategy Enhanced

The classic wheel strategy involves:
1. Selling cash-secured puts to collect premium
2. Taking assignment of shares if ITM at expiration
3. Selling covered calls on assigned shares
4. Repeating the cycle when shares are called away

**WheelForge takes this further with:**
- **Multi-layer positioning** for averaging down opportunities
- **Premium-adjusted cost basis tracking** for optimal strike selection
- **Automatic option rolling** to manage positions before expiration
- **Per-symbol configuration** for tailored risk management
- **Enterprise reliability** with retry logic, circuit breakers, and thread safety

## ⚡ Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- ✅ **Intelligent Option Selection** - Advanced scoring algorithm balancing return vs assignment risk
- ✅ **Multi-Layer Wheels** - Run multiple wheel cycles per symbol for dollar-cost averaging
- ✅ **Cost Basis Optimization** - Tracks premiums to adjust cost basis for better exits
- ✅ **Automatic Rolling** - Roll positions before expiration with configurable strategies
- ✅ **Database Tracking** - SQLite database for all trades, premiums, and performance metrics
- ✅ **Per-Symbol Configuration** - Customize contracts and settings for each ticker

### Reliability & Safety
- 🔒 **Thread-Safe Operations** - Prevents race conditions with proper locking

- 📊 **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Detailed logging and performance tracking
- ⚠️ **API Validation** - Validates all broker responses for completeness

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wheelforge.git
cd wheelforge
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
uv pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configuration

Create `.env` for API credentials:
```env
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret
IS_PAPER=true  # Start with paper trading
```

Configure strategy in `config/strategy_config.json` or use the interactive manager:
```bash
python scripts/config_manager.py
```

First run (clean slate):
```bash
run-strategy --fresh-start
```

Regular operation:
```bash
run-strategy
```

With full logging:
```bash
run-strategy --strat-log --log-level DEBUG --log-to-file
```

## 📈 Advanced Configuration

```json
{
  "balance_settings": {
    "allocation_percentage": 0.5,  // Use 50% of account

    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Core Components

### Strategy Engine (`core/strategy.py`)
Implements the scoring algorithm:
```
score = (1 - |Δ|) × (250 / (DTE + 5)) × (bid_price / strike_price)
```
Balancing annualized return with assignment probability.

### Position Management (`core/state_manager.py`)
Tracks wheel states:
- `short_put` → Assignment → `long_shares`
- `long_shares` → Covered call → `short_call`
- `short_call` → Assignment/Expiry → Repeat

### Database System (`core/database.py`)
- Premium tracking and analysis
- Cost basis adjustments
- Position history
- Performance metrics

### Execution Engine (`core/execution.py`)
- Thread-safe trade execution
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Circuit breaker protection
- Transaction logging

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Database Viewer
```bash
# Overall performance summary
python scripts/db_viewer.py --summary

# Cost basis with premium adjustments
python scripts/db_viewer.py --cost-basis

# Symbol-specific analysis
python scripts/db_viewer.py --symbol AAPL --all

# Premium collection history
python scripts/db_viewer.py --premiums --days 60
```

### Strategy Logs
- **Runtime logs**: Console/file output for monitoring
- **Strategy JSON logs**: Detailed trade analysis in `strategy_logging/`

## 🤖 Automation

### Linux/Mac Cron Setup
```cron
# Run at market open, midday, and before close
0 10 * * 1-5 /path/to/run-strategy >> /logs/morning.log 2>&1
0 13 * * 1-5 /path/to/run-strategy >> /logs/midday.log 2>&1
30 15 * * 1-5 /path/to/run-strategy >> /logs/closing.log 2>&1
```

### Windows Task Scheduler
Create scheduled tasks to run `run-strategy.exe` at desired intervals.

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

Comprehensive test suite included:
```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/test_error_handling.py
python tests/test_database.py
python tests/test_strategy_logic.py
python tests/test_risk_management.py
```

## 💡 Unique Enhancements

### Premium-Adjusted Cost Basis
WheelForge automatically adjusts your cost basis based on collected premiums:
- Buy shares at $100 (from put assignment)
- Sell covered call for $2 → Adjusted basis: $98
- System targets strikes ≥ $98 for improved exit probability

### Multi-Layer Wheel Management
Run multiple wheel cycles simultaneously:
- Layer 1: Initial put → shares → covered call
- Layer 2: New put while holding Layer 1 shares
- Enables averaging down in volatile markets

### Intelligent Rolling Strategies
Three rolling approaches available:
- **Forward Roll**: Same/higher strike, later expiration
- **Down Roll**: Lower strike for better assignment odds
- **Adaptive**: Best option based on scoring algorithm

## 🛡️ Production Considerations

### Before Live Trading
1. ✅ Paper trade for 2-4 weeks minimum
2. ✅ Start with conservative settings (30% allocation, 0.20+ delta)
3. ✅ Monitor closely for first week of live trading
4. ✅ Review all risk settings in configuration
5. ✅ Understand options risks and mechanics

### Safety Features
