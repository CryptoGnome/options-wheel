# WheelForge - Professional Options Wheel Strategy Platform

An enterprise-grade automated trading system implementing the options wheel strategy with advanced position management, automatic rolling, and intelligent risk controls.

## üéØ What is WheelForge?

WheelForge is a production-ready automated trading platform that executes the options wheel strategy using the Alpaca Trading API. Built with reliability and profitability in mind, it features enterprise-grade error handling, intelligent position management, and sophisticated risk controls that go beyond basic wheel implementations.

### The Wheel Strategy Enhanced

The classic wheel strategy involves:
1. Selling cash-secured puts to collect premium
2. Taking assignment of shares if ITM at expiration
3. Selling covered calls on assigned shares
4. Repeating the cycle when shares are called away

**WheelForge takes this further with:**
- **Multi-layer positioning** for averaging down opportunities
- **Premium-adjusted cost basis tracking** for optimal strike selection
- **Automatic option rolling** to manage positions before expiration
- **Per-symbol configuration** for tailored risk management
- **Enterprise reliability** with retry logic, circuit breakers, and thread safety

## ‚ö° Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Option Selection** - Advanced scoring algorithm balancing return vs assignment risk
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Layer Wheels** - Run multiple wheel cycles per symbol for dollar-cost averaging
- ‚úÖ **Cost Basis Optimization** - Tracks premiums to adjust cost basis for better exits
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Rolling** - Roll positions before expiration with configurable strategies

```

## üîß Core Components

### Strategy Engine (`core/strategy.py`)
Implements the scoring algorithm:
```
score = (1 - |Œî|) √ó (250 / (DTE + 5)) √ó (bid_price / strike_price)
```
Balancing annualized return with assignment probability.

### Position Management (`core/state_manager.py`)
Tracks wheel states:
- `short_put` ‚Üí Assignment ‚Üí `long_shares`
- `long_shares` ‚Üí Covered call ‚Üí `short_call`
- `short_call` ‚Üí Assignment/Expiry ‚Üí Repeat

### Database System (`core/database.py`)
- Premium tracking and analysis
- Cost basis adjustments
- Position history
- Performance metrics

### Execution Engine (`core/execution.py` & `core/execution_limit.py`)
- Thread-safe trade execution
- Choice of market or limit orders
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Circuit breaker protection
- Transaction logging

### Order Management (`core/order_manager.py`)
- Tracks pending limit orders
- Automatic price adjustments
- Progressive repricing logic
- Order lifecycle management

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Database Viewer
```bash
# Overall performance summary
python scripts/db_viewer.py --summary

# Cost basis with premium adjustments
python scripts/db_viewer.py --cost-basis

# Symbol-specific analysis
python scripts/db_viewer.py --symbol AAPL --all

# Premium collection history
python scripts/db_viewer.py --premiums --days 60
```

### Strategy Logs
- **Runtime logs**: Console/file output for monitoring
- **Strategy JSON logs**: Detailed trade analysis in `strategy_logging/`

## ü§ñ Automation

### Market Orders (run-strategy)
Best for scheduled execution at specific times:

#### Linux/Mac Cron Setup
```cron
# Run at market open, midday, and before close
0 10 * * 1-5 /path/to/run-strategy >> /logs/morning.log 2>&1
0 13 * * 1-5 /path/to/run-strategy >> /logs/midday.log 2>&1
30 15 * * 1-5 /path/to/run-strategy >> /logs/closing.log 2>&1
```

#### Windows Task Scheduler
Create scheduled tasks to run `run-strategy.exe` at desired intervals.

### Limit Orders (run-strategy-limit)
Best for continuous operation during market hours:

#### Linux/Mac
```bash
# Run as a service or in screen/tmux
screen -S wheelforge
run-strategy-limit --update-interval 60 --cycle-interval 300
# Detach with Ctrl+A, D
```

#### Windows
```powershell
# Run in background
Start-Process run-strategy-limit -ArgumentList "--update-interval 60" -WindowStyle Hidden
```

### Choosing Between Market and Limit Orders
- **Market Orders**: Simple, immediate execution, good for scheduled runs
- **Limit Orders**: Better prices, requires continuous monitoring, saves on spreads

## üß™ Testing & Validation

Comprehensive test suite included:
```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/test_error_handling.py
python tests/test_database.py
python tests/test_strategy_logic.py
python tests/test_risk_management.py
```

## üí° Unique Enhancements

### Premium-Adjusted Cost Basis
WheelForge automatically adjusts your cost basis based on collected premiums:
- Buy shares at $100 (from put assignment)
- Sell covered call for $2 ‚Üí Adjusted basis: $98
- System targets strikes ‚â• $98 for improved exit probability

### Multi-Layer Wheel Management
Run multiple wheel cycles simultaneously:
- Layer 1: Initial put ‚Üí shares ‚Üí covered call
- Layer 2: New put while holding Layer 1 shares
- Enables averaging down in volatile markets

### Intelligent Rolling Strategies
Three rolling approaches available:
- **Forward Roll**: Same/higher strike, later expiration
- **Down Roll**: Lower strike for better assignment odds
- **Adaptive**: Best option based on scoring algorithm

### Smart Limit Order System
Avoid paying the full bid-ask spread with intelligent order management:
- **Initial Pricing**: Orders start at bid-ask midpoint for optimal fills
- **Automatic Repricing**: Unfilled orders reprice every 60 seconds (configurable)
- **Progressive Strategy**: Each reprice becomes slightly more aggressive
- **Order Expiration**: Auto-cancels after 30 minutes if unfilled
- **Market Hours Operation**: Runs continuously during trading hours

## üõ°Ô∏è Production Considerations
